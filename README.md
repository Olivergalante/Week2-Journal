# Week2-Journal

Week 2 of my Carolina Code School experience and I cant belive its been 2 weeks already! I am excited to have this experience with such great and helpful people. I feel more tired than I thought I would but I cherish this whole experience. Finally being in a space showing what determination has done for has felt better than anything before. I love this change this space and where I am at mentalty.
